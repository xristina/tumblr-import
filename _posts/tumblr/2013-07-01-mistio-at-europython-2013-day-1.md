The EuroPython conference launched today with hundreds of Pythonistas in Grand Hotel Mediterraneo in Florence. Mist.io couldn’t miss the biggest European Python event of the year! We’re co-sponsoring the conference of our favorite programming language and report to those not lucky enough to attend.

Python turned twenty a couple of years ago, and with that in mind the Chairman of the Board of the Python Software Foundation, V. Van Lindberg, laid out the plans, hopes and ideas for the next 20 years of Python.

Citing some very impressive examples, Armin Ronacher, underlined the importance of thinking outside the box, emphasizing on engineers working with tight restrictions that were able to tackle issues in a non-conventional way. The morning session ended with Holger Krekel giving a very powerful speech on the importance of Peer2Peer networks for the future of the internet. Is the internet still a liberating technology or has it evolved through a centralized flow of information to a spying agency’s wet dream? He advocated for P2P hardware and software solutions, not only for their increased efficiency and redundancy over centralized networks, but also as a way for the internet users to reclaim their data and privacy.

Still thinking about the ways we can fight back against surveillance, we headed for lunch and for some networking with fellow Pythonistas from Europe and the rest of the world. Google, Amazon, HP Cloud, Openstack, Red Hat, Django and many more were there with gifts, puzzles and presents for all the conference participants.

Several minutes later and back to the “Spaghetti” room, Alex Martelli was explaining why Worst is Best and why the New Jersey attitude of getting your code out there knowing that it contains some bugs, prevailed over the MIT philosophy of grand design and striving for perfection. As some historical examples of that battle and prevalence, he mentioned the widespread adoption of TCP/IP which was “out there, working” with minimum consensus versus the ISO/OSI standard, or how the WWW and HTML -although far from perfect- prevailed over Project’s Xanadu aim for perfection which left it almost forever at the design stage.

The conference continued with hiring sessions from well established companies like Google and Amazon, which was our cue to leave, exhausted as we were from our late night travelling and early morning wake-up. Sadly, we missed the lightning talks, but we do have to prepare our own (lightning talk)for Wednesday ;)

Overall, a great start for this year’s EuroPython conference and looking at the schedule it seems that the rest of the week will be awesome as well.
