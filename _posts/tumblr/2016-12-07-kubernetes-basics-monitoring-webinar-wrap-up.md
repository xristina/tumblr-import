Cheers again to all who joined us last week for another in-depth discussion on Kubernetes and monitoring with our friends at GigaSpaces. We got a number of great questions and are looking forward to doing more of these events, in a continuing series.

[Click here to watch the recorded video](https://mist-1.wistia.com/medias/phpfnfdst0), or [check out the presentation on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/mistio/kubernetes-basics-monitoring). Additionally, we’ve posted [fresh, ready-to-run k8s manifests now available on GitLab](https://gitlab.ops.mist.io/mistio/kubernetes-demo/tree/master).

Missed our October event on Moving to Microservices; how to plan and time migrations, avoid the gotchas and more? [Join us for a Co-Founders’ view on these topics this Thursday](https://www.packet.net/campaigns/monolith-to-microservices/)&nbsp;when&nbsp;we’ll be covering these issues again, this time joined by Aaron Welch from Packet for his take on them.
