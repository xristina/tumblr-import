I’m excited to announce the private beta release of our Cloudify Orchestration Service!

This new capability allows you to quickly provisioning infrastructure and applications across your public and private cloud infrastructure directly from the Mist.io console using a Cloudify blueprint.

When you combine this with our other reporting and management features, you can create automated and dynamic workflows and policies to more intelligently manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure - all from a single UI!

The new Cloudify Orchestration service can bring real value by giving you the ability to save money by intelligently managing your hybrid infrastructure.

## **How it Works**

The Cloudify Orchestration Service is based on Cloudify, the open-source, TOSCA-based orchestration platform. Think of AWS’ OpsWorks, but for multi-cloud and private infrastructure.

You can create a single, reusable Cloudify blueprint (or choose an existing one from our catalog) and use the Mist.io console to provision the same application across different cloud providers, data centers, or even colo environments.

The goal is to make it easy for you to deploy applications across public and private clouds through a simple and hassle-free orchestration/automation solution.

## **Why Cloudify**

What made Cloudify so compelling and a no-brainer for us is the technology agnostic approach of the Cloudify software, which aligns perfectly with our values and strategic approach of helping our users avoid vendor lock-in. You can learn more about Cloudify, the community, and how to create blueprints by visiting [getcloudify.org](http://getcloudify.org/).

## **Getting Started**

The Cloudify Orchestration Service is currently in private beta. Our existing users can join the private beta by contacting Mist.io support to have their account enabled. If you are not a Mist.io user, just sign up for a free Mist.io account and request access to the beta program by submitting a ticket to our support team or go to our [Cloud Orchestration](https://mist.io/orchestration) page and sign up for the beta.

As always, we look forward to your feedback.
