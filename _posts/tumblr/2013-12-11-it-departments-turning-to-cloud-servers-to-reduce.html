<p>According to <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9244574/IT_managers_are_increasingly_replacing_servers_with_SaaS_">Computerworld</a>, 25 to 30% of servers shipped next year are going to cloud providers. This shift is slowing the server sales to enterprise IT departments. The increased use of SaaS is a major reason for the market shift, but also a big factor is server virtualization in order to increase efficiency and capacity. The increased use of public cloud solutions is expected to drive server revenue down by 3.5% this year, a clear sign that cloud solutions are cheaper and more effective than bare metal servers. In three years, by 2017, nearly 45% of all the servers leaving manufacturers will be bought by cloud providers.</p>

<p>We are rapidly moving to an IT world that will be powered by hybrid public and private solutions. Public cloud providers offer reliability, cost reduction and scalability but there are still reasons to retain control of your infrastructure. Privacy and trust issues are the reason that CIOs and IT departments prefer to have part of their infrastructure tightly controlled. </p>
<p>Public providers have had a setback last year when NSA&rsquo;s activities were leaked by Edward Snowden, resulting in reluctance from businesses and system administrators to store sensitive data on cloud servers. Major cloud providers are now fighting back to change that notion by releasing a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/nsa-surveillance-tech-companies-demand-sweeping-changes-to-us-laws">joint statement</a> asking the US government to put a stop to NSA&rsquo;s monitoring activities.</p>
<p>It is evident that hybrid public and private clouds, mixed with traditional bare metal server solutions will be the most common infrastructure setup for the coming years. And it is a good thing that we are already adapting to this new IT environment and there are already some excellent tools out there that can help server management in this new IT era.</p>
