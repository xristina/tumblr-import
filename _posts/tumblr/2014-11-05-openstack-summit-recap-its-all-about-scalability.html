<p><span>The first two days of the OpenStack Summit were exciting and action packed. We witnessed the major OpenStack vendors crossing swords at the </span><a href="https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/f6331df59f685bdd87d1b0fbf75e174a#.VFjjkPTF-5A">OpenStack Thunderdome</a>, Canonical officially <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/canonical-officially-unveils-its-openstack-distro-7000035338/">announcing Ubuntu OpenStack</a> and CERN <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/11/04/cern-details-openstack-journey/">talking about its 70.000 core OpenStack clusters</a>. The issues most talked about, were definitely VM and network provisioning, OpenStack scalability and NFVs.</p>

<p>Today, day 3, will be even more about NFVs. From the <a href="https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/c9b8bc0addf5f124bfb9eca4d3766d87#.VFki9VPF-wE">Openstack Networking Hands-on Labs</a> to more advanced use cases, many sessions are covering network virtualization. It is the next big thing for telcos as it aims to accelerate new service deployments. Of course <a href="https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/bd50f1d31153032e2c92c38a7027691a#.VFng1fmsWZN">everyone</a> wants a piece of that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spirent.com/">Spirent Communications</a> is leading the field in SDN/NFV testing for telcos. They’ve recently published an article on <a href="http://vmsec.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/blog-implementing-continuous-cloud-validation/">OpenStack Network Testing</a> using <a href="https://mist.io/">Mist.io</a> to automate the testing procedure.</p>
