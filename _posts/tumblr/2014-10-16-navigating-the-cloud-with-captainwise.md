**What Captainwise needed**

As Captainwise started gaining traction in the market , more and more people began using their service. In addition to the usual server monitoring and alerting, they needed to keep track of how many people their servers could hold, when their infrastructure load spiked and a way to quickly provision new servers for testing.

**What Mist.io delivered**

Once we identified their issues, we helped them add their backends to Mist.io which reduced the provisioning and configuring time to just a few seconds. We then moved on to setting up monitoring for the underlying infrastructure and set up alerts in case something went wrong. After a few days of monitoring, Mist.io had gathered enough data to check the historic load graphs, identify any changes or spikes and correlate them with their analytics software.

This process enabled Captain Wise to identify their bottlenecks as well as the underlying cause and eventually optimize their software stack where it mattered. The effect was improved customer experience and a proactive approach to managing issues.
