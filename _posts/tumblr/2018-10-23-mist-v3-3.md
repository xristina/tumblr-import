Today we are happy to announce version 3.3 of the Mist Cloud Management Platform. We are excited about v3.3 because it brings:

- A brand new volumes section from where you can manage block storage across clouds.
- Support for multiple network interfaces and static IP configuration for KVM guests.
- UI performance improvements that allow seamless management of thousands of resources.
- A new section for quick overview of all your clouds.  
- Saved searches to go through your logs faster.
- Support for snapshots for VMware vSphere virtual machines.

## Volumes

Mist v3.3 brings support for block storage volumes on public and private clouds. Mist auto-discovers your existing volumes in seconds so you know exactly what you have and where. Right out-of-the-box you will be able to see which of your volumes are used and which you should delete to save money. On top of all common actions like create, delete, attach, detach etc you are also able to associate volumes with tags and teams. This allows additional visibility, e.g. quickly finding the owner of a volume. It also allows control through Mist’s RBAC, e.g. giving the right only to specific teams to create new volumes. Block storage is currently supported for Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud Platform and OpenStack.

## KVM networking

One of the most common pain points for KVM users is network configuration; topologies might differ between hosts and guests, DHCP might or might not be there etc. To ease this pain, Mist now offers options for configuring multiple network interfaces per guest. It is also possible to manually configure IP addresses during provisioning.

## Clouds section

Mist v3.3 brings a new Clouds section to help you quickly navigate your inventory. From this section you can get a quick overview of which clouds you have connected to Mist and how many machines, networks, volumes and DNS zones are provided by each one.

## Saved searches

Many log searches are fairly repetitive. When the parameters of a query are complicated Mist’s free form search wasn’t very helpful. That’s why Mist v3.3 introduces saved searches. The only thing you need to do is type your query once and hit save. Every time you log in again you can simply select it and get the results. In future versions we will extend this functionality to all search forms in Mist’s interface.

## UI performance improvements

When managing several thousands of resources, the Mist UI may need to do a lot of heavy lifting to maintain an up to date overview at all times. In some cases this might impact user experience. In this release, we refactored the front-end code that was responsible for most of the bottlenecks in the UI. The result of this effort is a seamless experience, even when managing thousands of machines.

## vSphere snapshots

Some of Mist.io’s biggest customers are heavy VMware users. In the same time they run a lot of infrastructure on public clouds. For this reason Mist has become their first stop when they need to perform a certain action. To simplify their daily routines Mist v3.3 brings support for snapshots in vSphere virtual machines. Users can now create and revert to snapshots from within Mist without having to jump back and forth vSphere or vCenter.

## Conclusion

With so many changes in this version we recommend you sign in Mist.io and try things out. For Community Edition users, the latest version and instructions on how to install can be found at&nbsp;[https://github.com/mistio/mist-ce/](https://github.com/mistio/mist-ce/)
