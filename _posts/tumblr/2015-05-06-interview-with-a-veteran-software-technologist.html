He was heavily involved in the creation and emergence of object-oriented programming technology. In the last few years, he&rsquo;s been very involved in the evolution of JavaScript as the technical editor of the JavaScript standard. We invited cloud blogger <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/nachmani">Ofir Nachmani</a> to interview Allen and here are the results.<b><br/></b></p><h2>Ofir: Tell us a bit about what ambient computing is and how it is influenced by the cloud.</h2><p><b>Allen</b>: In the last few years, I’ve been working on the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_intelligence">ambient computing</a>, which is the idea that we&rsquo;re living in a world where we don’t use computers. Rather, computers surround us and augment our living and working environments. Interestingly, the cloud is one of the major components of the ambient computing environment within which we live. It&rsquo;s where our data goes to live, where the information that we interact with is crunched and returned to us in a meaningful way. It&rsquo;s the place where all smart devices we deal with connect.</p><h2>ON: How does Mist.io tie into ambient computing, and how has your experience been with the team over the past few years?</h2><p><b>Allen</b>: One of the intriguing things I find about Mist.io is that they&rsquo;re trying to provide a framework to manage data in an ambient cloud of information that&rsquo;s been striving towards this new generation of computing. </p><p>I came to know them through the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/mozilla-launches-an-incubator-program-for-the-open-web/">Mozilla Web Forward Incubator Program</a>, which was an incubator for companies using open source software. I was a mentor and advisor in that program, where I worked with them for the first time. One of the goals of that program was to work with companies that aren’t solely located in Silicon Valley. As you know, half of Mist.io’s team is located in Silicon Valley, while the other half is in Greece. </p><h2>ON: What kinds of challenges do you think companies face when they’re not entirely located, in Silicon Valley, if they’re located there all? Do you see any advantages?</h2><p><b>Allen</b>: Companies that aren’t located in Silicon Valley are still exposed to a lot of the culture, they’re just not immersed in it in quite the same way. Some company founders find that culture very attractive and wish they could be a part of it. However, my own experience with startups outside Silicon Valley has taught me that there are some significant advantages to being on the outside.</p><p>Silicon Valley created a &ldquo;shiny new thing&rdquo; culture, where if a new company isn’t booming quick enough, investors and employees may pull out to move on to the next big thing. Even if a company’s founders have a unique and distinct vision, they can often be influenced by investors, their board, and the surrounding culture. As a result, their focus can be shifted to quickly generating a profit. </p><p>On the other hand, I’ve found that startups and companies outside of Silicon Valley tend to be a bit more stable, and oriented more towards building a solid company. They often want to build a company that will be around for many years, create jobs, contribute to its local economy. They seem to be more traditional, in the sense that they’re company builders.</p><p>In addition, today&rsquo;s cloud services have provided the infrastructure that&rsquo;s needed to develop software services and applications that are used all over the world. This infrastructure is available to anybody, wherever they may be. The best part is, you don&rsquo;t need to be in Silicon Valley to build it—you can be anywhere.</p><h2>ON: How do you see startup culture evolving in the next five to ten years and how will the cloud influence it?</h2><p><b>Allen</b>: There are plenty of startups outside of Silicon Valley already doing great things. It’s just not possible for everyone to be located there. It’s also possible that in ten or fifteen years, Silicon Valley will be replaced by some other place. As we move further in the ambient computing world, we should recognize that software has to be done everywhere, and not only from an American or Californian perspective. Software is ultimately about people, and people are located all over the world.</p>
