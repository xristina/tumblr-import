We have just returned from Berlin and [Tech All Stars 2013](http://techallstars.eu "Tech All Stars 2013") , an event organized&nbsp;by the European Commission to connect the top 12 European startups. Mist.io was selected out of 300 applicants to join the privileged 12 for the first round of the event.

We had an excellent time in these 3 days. We pitched, discussed technical & entrepreneurial issues with the rest of the teams and learned what’s the status in terms of technology and startups in other European countries.

More importantly, we got to connect with really interesting people who have great ideas and great stories like those from [Snap Fashion](http://www.snapfashion.co.uk/), [Babelverse](http://babelverse.com/) and [Infantium](http://www.infantium.com/), amongst others.
