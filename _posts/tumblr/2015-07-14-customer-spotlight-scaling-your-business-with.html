<br/><br/><p><strong>What Book’n’Bloom needed</strong></p><p>Book’n’Bloom uses a three level development workflow and its resources are distributed among different providers such as Openshift Online by Red Hat, Linode and Digital Ocean. They were looking to cover their monitoring needs and solve performance issues by identifying possible bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>What Mist.io delivered</strong></p><p>After a thorough research on graphing solutions and counting in resources needed for this project, they decided to go with Mist.io. Using Mist.io’s standard server dashboard plus custom, application-specific metrics, Book'n'Bloom keeps track of things over time, and makes sure every part of the system serves their customers and developers throughout the day.</p><p>Using a single UI and API to manage and monitor their entire infrastructure greatly reduced the complexity that came with using several different platforms.</p><p>

After a few days of monitoring, Mist.io had gathered enough data to check the historic load graphs, identify any changes or spikes and correlate them with their analytics software. This process enabled Book’n’Bloom to identify their bottlenecks as well as the underlying cause and eventually optimize their software stack where it mattered.
