<p>How many VMs did the QA team spin up this week? Do we have any idle development VMs that could be powered down? How much would we save if we transferred our infrastructure to another cloud provider? How much are we actually spending right now?<b><br/></b></p><p>These questions are becoming harder to answer as companies embrace flexible and diverse infrastructure environments. In order to answer them, managers require access to more, real-time infrastructure data. And while moving to a multi cloud environment can bring tremendous gains in flexibility and speed, it can also bring complexity and lack of visibility.</p><p>Increasing infrastructure visibility has always been one of the key points of using Mist.io. Managing all your servers from a single place can help find and power down forgotten, idle servers that can greatly add to your expenses. And with cloud cost reporting coming soon, you&rsquo;ll be able to know exactly how much you&rsquo;re spending each moment. Even more, you&rsquo;ll be able to see how much you&rsquo;re spending for each cloud and make informed decisions on where you can cut costs and how much switching to a new cloud provider will save you.</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="383" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b19cf87570d39b8880dce86349ff6b5f/tumblr_inline_oabeugc8571rgqrs8_540.png" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="383"/></figure><p><b></b></p><p>Or even at a machine level to pinpoint which servers are impacting your expenses significantly</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="441" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/28f3b6ec5611c0cbfbb710d641f091d4/tumblr_inline_oabev2H5TQ1rgqrs8_540.png" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="441"/></figure><p><br/>Mist.io estimates monthly costs based on the data we get from the providers. But you can also set a custom price for your machines. To learn more on how the cost reporting feature works, check out the <a href="http://docs.mist.io/article/103-cost-reporting-with-mist-io">relevant documentation</a>.<br/></p><p>Cloud cost reporting is tied to our new, polymer-based UI that is coming out in a couple of months. However, if you&rsquo;re interested in trying it out now, we would love some early feedback. Just drop us an email at support@mist.io and we&rsquo;ll enable access to the new UI and the cost reporting feature.<br/></p>
