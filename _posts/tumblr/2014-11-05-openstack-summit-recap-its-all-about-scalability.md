The first two days of the OpenStack Summit were exciting and action packed. We witnessed the major OpenStack vendors crossing swords at the [OpenStack Thunderdome](https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/f6331df59f685bdd87d1b0fbf75e174a#.VFjjkPTF-5A), Canonical officially [announcing Ubuntu OpenStack](http://www.zdnet.com/canonical-officially-unveils-its-openstack-distro-7000035338/) and CERN [talking about its 70.000 core OpenStack clusters](http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/11/04/cern-details-openstack-journey/). The issues most talked about, were definitely VM and network provisioning, OpenStack scalability and NFVs.

Today, day 3, will be even more about NFVs. From the [Openstack Networking Hands-on Labs](https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/c9b8bc0addf5f124bfb9eca4d3766d87#.VFki9VPF-wE) to more advanced use cases, many sessions are covering network virtualization. It is the next big thing for telcos as it aims to accelerate new service deployments. Of course [everyone](https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/bd50f1d31153032e2c92c38a7027691a#.VFng1fmsWZN) wants a piece of that.

[Spirent Communications](http://www.spirent.com/) is leading the field in SDN/NFV testing for telcos. They’ve recently published an article on [OpenStack Network Testing](http://vmsec.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/blog-implementing-continuous-cloud-validation/) using [Mist.io](https://mist.io/) to automate the testing procedure.

If you want to know more, drop by [our session](https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/3d659110d2931bd63c4d53fab176f312) to hear [Dimitris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimmo) and [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=324906011) present how Spirent leverages Mist.io’s API for network testing, OpenStack monitoring and management.
