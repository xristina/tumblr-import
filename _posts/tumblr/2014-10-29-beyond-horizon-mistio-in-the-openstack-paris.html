<p>With the OpenStack Summit less than a week away, the Mist.io team is getting ready for Paris. Our CTO Dimitris Moraitis along with our lead OpenStack engineer Chris Loukas, will be presenting <a href="https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/3d659110d2931bd63c4d53fab176f312">a session titled “Beyond Horizon”</a> on Wednesday afternoon. They will be talking about open-source tools that provide a unified way of managing all of your infrastructure, from Docker containers to multiple OpenStack installations and from bare metal servers to VMs across public clouds.</p>

<p>Don’t get us wrong, <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/">Horizon</a> is a powerful UI for OpenStack management. However, when dealing with hybrid environments or multiple OpenStack deployments you end up using several different tools to get your job done. Mist.io simplifies this and helps you increase your efficiency by centralizing server management in a platform-independent fashion. You can control provisioning and orchestration of computing resources through the web, the command line, our RESTful API, or through your Python scripts and Ansible playbooks. Additionally, the premium <a href="https://mist.io"><a href="https://mist.io">https://mist.io</a></a> service can help you monitor any system or application metric. It will alert you when things go wrong and most importantly, it makes automation as simple as it should be. Last, but not least, you get a touch friendly web console to access your servers safely from any device.</p>
<p>In Paris, we will be showcasing Mist.io and going through the architecture and technology powering it. We will discuss how to achieve auto-scaling and Cloud automation, while avoiding complex setups and vendor lock-ins. We will look at how <a href="http://www.spirent.com/">Spirent</a> makes use of Mist.io for Continuous Cloud Validation and NFV testing solutions, and how the<a href="http://boldprogressives.org/"> Progressive Change Campaign Committee</a> can quickly scale its campaigning by fast deploying cloud VMs using Mist.io’s API and Ansible modules.</p>
<p><span>Finally, we are planning to announce some major new features regarding OpenStack management during the Summit, so stay tuned!</span></p>
