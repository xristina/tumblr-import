<p>At <a href="https://mist.io">Mist.io</a>, we base our business on trust and reliability. But when it comes to your servers’ health and uptime, there is a problem with startups. Short life-expectancy. Most startups will either stagnate and die, or succeed and get acquired by someone bigger.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, there have been a series of acquisitions in the cloud management market: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/07/google-acquires-cloud-monitoring-service-stackdriver/">Google bought StackDriver</a>, <a href="http://www.flexiant.com/news/flexiant-acquires-besols-tapp-multi-cloud-management-technology-and-business/">Tapp was acquired by Flexiant</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/07/citrix-gets-cloud-management-tech-with-the-acquisition-of-scalextreme/">Citrix bought ScaleXtreme</a>.</p>
<p>We have suffered by services we got to rely upon being shut down and we don’t want to be one of them. So we always make sure that even if at some point we have to shut down a product, we will have your back covered. Thats why we pledge the following:</p>
<ul><li>If we shut down a product, you will be able to export your data in a non-proprietary format that can be accessed by open-source software.</li>
<li>We were in Mozilla’s <a href="https://webfwd.org/about/">WebFWD</a> third cohort and we believe in open standards. Most of our code is already open-source and we will release the rest and help you setup your own instance.</li>
<li>We already have a powerful API, but we will build export scripts to help you get your data as easily as possible.</li>
<li>You will have plenty of time to set up your own instances. We will keep our services running for as long as possible.</li>
</ul><p>We love Mist.io and we would like to be able to promise you that we’ll keep it running forever. But eternity is a long time and we’re not in the business of making promises we can’t keep. What we can do, is assure you that we want to build a product that will outlast our company and that we will never turn our back on our users. Trust, can only be built upon mutual respect.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>The Mist.io team</p>
