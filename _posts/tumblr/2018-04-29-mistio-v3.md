We are happy to announce version 3 of the Mist.io Cloud Management Platform.

Some of the most notable changes are:

- **Monitoring with InfluxDB and Telegraf**. Mist.io now offers a fully open source monitoring option to our Community Edition users. At the same time the whole monitoring service is more extensible and easy to maintain.
- **New rules engine**. It’s now trivial to set rules that apply to groups of machines, both existing and new ones. This almost eliminates the mundane effort of setting up such policies across your infrastructure. If you’d like to dig deeper you could check out our docs [here](https://docs.mist.io/article/156-rules-for-alerting-and-automating-responses).
- **Improved VMware vSphere support**. Provisioning, networks (list & assign), retrieve extended metadata.
- **Enterprise Edition.** &nbsp;The fully featured Mist platform is now available on-prem behind your firewall.
