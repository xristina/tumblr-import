​Day 3 at EuroPython 2013 and our day started with Thomas Waldmann giving a very interesting presentation on servers-side password handling in a packed Spaghetti room. After going over the most common mistakes developers do when storing passwords, e.g. using weak or outdated algorithms, using symmetric encryption etc, he highlighted the need for stronger password protection mechanisms as a single GPU can now compute more than a billion SHA256 hashes per second! He also recommended passlib as a very powerful and convenient python library that takes care of password storing and management in a simple and effective way.

​After the coffee break we headed up to the Ravioli room to watch a very interesting presentation by Goran Peretin about greenlet-based concurrency. He presented some very impressive speed and memory savings by using a greenlet approach versus a threaded one. He talked about how preemptive multitasking can become an issue when using the threaded approach and gave some great examples on how to use greenlets in your environment to speed up your application and do large scale deployments.

​After the lunch break we headed straight to the Lasagne room for a presentation by Tarek Ziade about Circus. Circus is a process and socket manager, similar to supervisord that is being developed at Mozilla Services. Overall it seems like a very promising project with some interesting features and a very easy to use plugin system. It’s not as mature as supervisord yet, but that is going to change soon as they’ve started using it in production.

​And then it was time for lightning talks. And who better to open the round of talks than our own CTO, Dimitris Moraitis, talking about mist.io. Overall, some great projects were presented and some very interesting python regional conferences were announced. Most importantly, the location for the next two EuroPython conferences was revealed and people were excited to find out that next July, we will be in Berlin!

​The evening was upon us, so we headed out to try some Florence delicacies at the PyBarbeque. Although not as well organized as the rest of the conference, the nice weather and the interesting people we met, more than made up for it.
