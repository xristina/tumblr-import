The Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) market, has been constantly evolving the past two years. In order to get a glimpse of what is in store for the feature, we have been interviewing some key people from the industry. We kicked off the series with [John Edgar](http://blog.mist.io/2014-01-21-paas-is-a-blessing-not-a-curse-an-interview-with), DigitalOcean’s Chief Technology Evangelist and [Telemachus Luu](http://blog.mist.io/2014-02-06-getting-to-100-uptime-on-public-cloud-an-interview), the CTO of Nephoscale.

Today, we are posting an interview with [Jonathan Siegel](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jsiegel). Jonathan is a repeat entrepreneur, angel investor, father of six and leader of Exceptional Cloud Services – a company Rackspace acquired in 2013. His insight on the IaaS market is unique, as he works closely with high-growth companies and new products at Rackspace.

**Businesses have been feverishly moving their infrastructure to public clouds. What should they pay attention to?**

It depends on what kind of business they are and what kind of specific needs they have. There’s this sense that cloud is a one-size-fits all solution, that you’ll eventually use it to replace all of your existing internal IT infrastructure with. Some companies are doing this, mostly startups with little or no existing investment in compute capacity. Most large companies are looking to the cloud to fill specific needs they have, to fill out a portfolio of compute capacity that also includes internal servers, private clouds and dedicated hosting.

First and foremost, pay attention to what you want to get out of your cloud experience and work with the provider most able to fill your needs.

**There are several IaaS providers out there. What is unique in what Rackspace offers?**

Look, there’s lots of things that make us special, from our unique culture to our commitment to Fanatical Support. But the thing that’s most resonating with high-growth companies right now is the fact that we’re closely coupling our public cloud with highly-customizable dedicated hardware. That gives them the opportunity to use our public cloud for variable or ephemeral workloads while maintaining high performance dedicated machines for static workloads, speed-dependent database applications or anything else that requires a more specialized and reliable infrastructure.

**What setups are currently popular and what do you think will gain popularity in the future? (eg hybrid, multicloud, bare metal + cloud machines)**

We’re really excited about how one of our customers is using dedicated hardware to deliver Drupal instances in seconds using Docker. It’s a novel approach that leverages some of the most exciting advancements in operating system-level virtualization. For details, please see our recent [blog post on Pantheon](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-pantheon-uses-containers-for-faster-scaling-lower-cost/).

**What do you see as the major challenges when it comes to increasing interoperability across IaaS solutions? Is this a priority for Rackspace? Why so?**

OpenStack interoperability and staying close to trunk. This is really hard to do and do well. We’ve stepped away from trunk ourselves to respond to customer demands and I’m very happy to see that we’re aggressively working to reconcile our installation with the community’s norms. Quickly integrating improvements and working in close collaboration with the OpenStack community is important to us and to our customers who really want true interoperability and portability between providers. I know this is something our senior technical leaders invest time thinking about every day.

**What do you think about the growing popularity of PaaS solutions? Do they constitute a threat or a boost to IaaS?**

Platform-as-a-Service is the right fit for some customers. We view it as complementary to our existing infrastructure offerings. In fact, we’re currently supporting two different platform services based on open infrastructure: the OpenStack Solum project and the Apache 2.0-licensed Cloud Foundry project. Check out a recent [blog post](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/a-tale-of-two-approaches-to-the-platform-service-layer-cloud-foundry-and-solum/) we did on the topic.

**What are Rackspace’s plans for the future? What features and enhancements should we expect to see?**

We’re going to be giving some of our dedicated machines real performance enhancements—real teeth—and a cloud-like interface. This is something our customers have been pulling us toward for some time and we’re happy to be committing real resources toward.

**What’s your favorite OS and text editor?**

Emacs + viper — the speed of VIM and power of Lisp. What more could you want?
