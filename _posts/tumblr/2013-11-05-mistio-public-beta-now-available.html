<p>Mist.io launched it’s private beta in May 2013 and today, we’re excited to announce that Mist.io is available for public beta. While cloud computing let’s us forget about hardware, it still requires a team to monitor servers from their computers. Valuable time is lost sitting at a desk monitoring servers. Mist.io changes all that by allowing developers, sysadmins, and IT managers to manage and monitor their servers across the clouds from any web device.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,000 developers signed up for Mist.io during our private beta. We have worked hard to incorporate the feedback and feature requests we heard. Today, we have a number of changes to Mist.io’s public beta that we think you will enjoy.</p>
<p>Just to give you a glimpse of the improvements, you&rsquo;ll now see:</p>
<p><strong>Easier to configure keys</strong>, you can paste, auto-generate or upload your private key<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>Improved image management</strong>, you can star you favorite ones for faster discovery but you can also search through every image offered by your providers</p>

<p>In addition, the underlying infrastructure is now more robust and the user workflow more natural. While we could go on about the improvements, it&rsquo;s best for you to <a href="https://mist.io/" title="mist.io homepage"><strong>log in and see for yourself</strong></a>. We&rsquo;re certain that whether you’re a developer, sysadmin, or IT manager, Mist.io can help make your day to day server management much easier.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, we plan to expand our support to even more cloud providers, upgrade our graphs and metrics system, support bare metal servers, and make server automation even more awesome. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
