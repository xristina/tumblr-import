Mist.io has partnered with Red Hat to develop a Kubernetes Operator of the Mist platform for Red Hat OpenShift.

For software companies, building and maintaining cloud-native applications today is not a simple task - they must address significant complexities during the initial build and provide maintenance across siloed cloud footprints. Helping to address these challenges are Operators, a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling. Kubernetes Operators simplify application development for Kubernetes platforms by abstracting away complexities and coding human operational knowledge into applications, creating services that can function without human intervention.

This service automation can improve the lives of both developers and operations teams, enabling Kubernetes applications to function like cloud services, from self-healing and self-provisioning capabilities to easier management and maintenance at production-scale. Built from the Operator Framework, applications can be instantly updated across all footprints simultaneously, limiting IT downtime and easing the burden of maintaining large clusters of Kubernetes applications.

In this context, Red Hat has launched a new initiative to support software companies in shipping their products as Kubernetes Operators.
