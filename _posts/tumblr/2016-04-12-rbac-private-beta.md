We are excited to announce the private beta release of role based access control (RBAC). With RBAC we can now deliver a complete solution for a common, but difficult to implement, use case:

- How to turn an IT organization into an internal broker of cloud services.&nbsp;

RBAC enables the seamless management of user permissions across infrastructure: public and private clouds, containers, hypervisors, and bare-metal devices.

To learn more about the Cloud Broker use case, refer to our Cloud Broker Case Study for details.

## **Beta Testing&nbsp;**

Mist.io users that requested access to the beta program will have their account enabled with RBAC. Send feedback and bugs to **[support@mist.io](http://docs.mist.io/contact).**

The “User” menu, in the upper right hand corner of the Dashboard, is where Organizations are managed. This is where you can switch between organizations and create new ones. Each user gets a “Personal” account by default.

The Mist.io dashboard now has a new Teams section. Click on “Teams” to get to the RBAC functionality. This is where you invite Members to join a Team and can create Rules. More on this later.

As a beta user, we want you to test the new RBAC functionality with your team members and existing infrastructure and provide feedback to help us improve the feature and user experience. Here are the specific workflows we want you to test:

- Create an organization (preferably more than one)  
- Switch context to the new organization  
- Add Clouds (preferably more than one)  
- Create a team (preferably more than one)  
- Define rules for each team  
- Invite 2+ members to join a team

Have members test the Rules with existing public cloud (AWS / Azure/ GCE), private cloud (OpenStack/VMware/KVM), containers, and bare-metal devices.

Here is additional information to help you with testing. You can also visit our [Documentation](http://docs.mist.io/article/102-role-based-access-control) section for more details.

## **Overview**

The new RBAC feature will only be available to private-beta users. If you signed up for the beta and RBAC doesn’t appear in your account please [contact us](http://docs.mist.io/contact).

## **Nomenclature**

- _Organization_ - an account can have many Organizations
- _Personal Account_ - the default user account
- _Team_ - a Team can have many Members
- _Member_ - Members belong to 1 or more Teams. Members have a username and password
- _Policy_ - a Policy is associated with a Team. A Policy can have many Rules
- Rule - Rules define Member permissions  

## **Roles**

- _Account owner_ - this role has complete administrative control; can create organizations, teams, add and remove members, and create and edit rules  
- _Members_ - the default role for everyone else; a member can’t create a team or rules or invite members to join a team.&nbsp;

A Team is only valid in the context of an Organization. A “Personal” context can’t create teams.

## **RBAC workflow for an account owner**

- Create an organization
- Switch context to the Organization
- Create a Team&nbsp;
- Add Rules to the team’s policy&nbsp;
- Invite members to join the team
- Rules will apply to all team members

Organizations, Teams, and Rules are created by an account owner. A policy is always associated with a Team. Rules are always associated with a Policy and define Member’s permissions. Example:

- An account owner can create Rules which reside in a policy that specify the public and private clouds team member can provision a virtual server on

Rules are always assigned to a Team rather than directly to Members. To grant permissions to a Member, you first need to assign a member to a Team. Members inherit access permissions from the Team. A Member can belong to more than one Organization and/or Team.

To get started, simply login to your Mist.io account. You should already have received an email stating that your account has been enabled with RBAC. If you need help, have feedback, or find a bug, please send an email to **[support@mist.io.](http://docs.mist.io/contact)&nbsp;**Or visit our [documentation](http://docs.mist.io/article/102-role-based-access-control)&nbsp;for more information.
