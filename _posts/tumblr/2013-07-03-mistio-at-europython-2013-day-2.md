​Back at EuroPython for the second day, after a very promising introduction yesterday. During the morning session, up at the Ravioli room, Florent Xicluna laid out the principles of writing python code with style, the various PEPs and the ways and tools that can help you enforce them (autopep8, autoflake, etc). At the same time back at the Spaghetti room, David Cramer was talking about his experience in starting an open source business with Sentry while he was still working for Disqus. While Sentry is a community project, 99% of the official code is still written by him. The value of open-source business is not in having a community to maintain the code, but to get visibility and enable others write stuff that you wouldn’t write yourself.

​The day went on with Flavio Percoco dissecting OpenStack’s projects and development methodologies. At the same time Disqus was blowing our minds by revealing that they deploy code every single day! Meanwhile, Hynek Schlawack was analyzing how to properly deploy your applications and to be as prepared as possible for most of the things that can go wrong during deployment. Besides, according to DevOps Borat “it’s all fun and game until you are need of put it in production". That’s when Vagrant, virtualenv, FPM and buildout stepped in.

​After lunch, we joined the Openstack hands-on workshop for a couple of quick sessions on Nova and Swift, where we used the OpenStack Python ​libraries to launch and destroy virtual machines.

​A -much needed- coffee break followed, right before we got ready to present mist.io to interested pythonistas during the poster session. A hands-on demo using our tablet was all it took to get people hooked up with our -at least according a pythonista- “slick UI and great idea".

​The day closed with Daniel Greenfeld talking about the strong points (and some of the short-comings) of Python and giving some very valuable advices for working with other developers inside a community. With the help of the Zen of Python wisdom, he revealed how silent exceptions are the Satan (with Comic Sans) and why you should run away from any tutorial that uses “import \*“ and never look back.

​Overall a very productive day, tons of stuff for python beginners and experts alike and great opportunities for networking.
