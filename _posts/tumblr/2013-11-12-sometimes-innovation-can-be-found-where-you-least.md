Last night, we were invited from the [University of Thessaly](http://www.uth.gr/en/) to give a talk on the topic of Startups and Innovation. The talk was held in Volos, a port strategically located in the center of Greece. Since almost half the population of Greece lives in Athens, we sometimes have a tendency to lose touch with what is happening in the rest of the country.

This time, we were pleasantly surprised. Prof. Staboulis and his team are doing an amazing job bringing together young developers and entrepreneurs. It was a chance to share our experience with many young people who had some very interesting &nbsp;ideas and that are hoping to build their own startups. For more than an hour, we touched a wide range of subjects: from funding to business plans and from mentorship&nbsp;to market validation.

The local startup ecosystem although still in its infancy, seems to have a lot of momentum. They are in progress of building a workspace of 600 sq. meters that will host startups and developers, theyâ€™re holding a [hackathon](http://voloshack.tk/)next weekend, and next month there will be a Startup Weekend in Volos in which we were asked to participate as mentors. Overall, last night was great.

Keep up the good work people!
