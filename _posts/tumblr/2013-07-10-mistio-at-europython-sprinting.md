After an action-packed week at EuroPython conference, the weekend was upon us and with it, the various coding sprints. In a full Spaghetti room, people gathered to improve their favorite Python tools: Django, Plone, Kivi, CPython, Flask, MoinMoin, Twisted, Pytest and of course mist.io.

Amongst coffee, paninis and pizzas the pythonistas laptops were on fire. The mist.io group set on itâ€™s task to integrate OpenStack with our product. We set up a devstack instance and development started moving very fast. After a few hours, basic openstack support was there. But we also needed to test and support virtual servers with public IPs, which we could not do with devstack. So, with the help of Cody Somerville from HPCloud we set up an account and launched our private openstack cloud. A few hours more and OpenStack support by mist.io was there. We will roll out our changes on production in the next iteration after we squash a couple of minor bugs left.

With a few more hours for the sprint to end, we moved on fixing a few other smaller issues before leaving the conference venue for good and the beautiful Florence with it. We had a great time on another engaging EuroPython conference and we hope to be there again to sponsor it next year on Berlin. Big thanks to Python Italia, the rest of the sponsors and of course the Python community for a very well organized and fruitful event.
