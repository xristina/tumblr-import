<p>Getting a notification when something is wrong with one of your servers is a crucial step in reducing your downtime. But a routine check of how your infrastructure is coping, can prevent server overloads and pinpoint possible infrastructure or application bottlenecks. </p>
<p><span>Going through each server and checking the load for the past day is thorough, albeit time consuming. So, today we are announcing a new type of graph that displays the load for all your servers combined.</span></p>

<p>With one glance you can see any spikes or any servers struggling, and act in a timely manner to prevent future downtime or application sluggishness. Being able to prevent downtime is as important as being able to respond quickly when a crisis eventually comes. So, set up your alerting rules to get notified when something goes wrong, but do not forget to check daily on your server’s performance.</p>
<p>This combined load graph is just the beginning of an ongoing effort, as we are planning to add more options and the ability to design your own custom combined graphs in the upcoming weeks, so stay tuned!</p>
